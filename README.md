## Project task
Main task of this project was to test out and play around with the functionalities of Supabase. User should be able to register and login into their account and from there the user should be able to reserve a parking spot for their chosen date, if the date doesen't have any available parking spaces the user shouldn't be able to reserve it. Also the user should be able to see their reserved parking spaces by date and cancel them.
